            I'm a software engineer from Singapore. I have over 10 years of experience, covering a breadth of job
            functions including business analysis, systems and processes design, coding, automated and manual testing
            and project management. I enjoy solving problems and building the solutions.

            I'm currently on a sabbatical from full-time employment, working on a personal passion project
            coffeebrewapps.com. If you have a problem that can be solved with a website or a web application, I can
            offer my service to you. Feel free to connect with me through my socials and we can figure out how to
            build the solution.

              This site is built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages, with the entire site layout and stylesheets

            <p>
              During my 6 years and 8 months in Ascenda, I have involved in a few key products development. From the
              company's hotel booking website Kaligo.com, to the company's points transfer network PointsTransfer, and
              finally the End-to-End loyalty platform sub-systems PointsBank and LoyaltyEngine.
            </p>
            <p>
              My job scope covered a breadth of responsibilities, including business analysis, systems design,
              implementation, testing and project management. Most notably, I have helped design and implement the
              LoyaltyEngine's complex points calculation and campaigns management modules from the ground up, which
              are critical modules used by large banks to process millions of transactions daily and reward loyalty
              points to their consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from product development, I was also project lead for two major launches on the E2E platform. Both
              projects have been successfully delivered on schedule, and received positive feedback from the clients.
              The system has been operational for more than a year and processes over a million records daily.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the pandemic period, where various teams from different geographical locations operate remotely,
              I was also involved in setting up processes to facilitate effective asynchronous and remote communication,
              including writing documentation for the system design and code development processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a senior engineer in the team, I was also mentor to four engineers, providing guidance on project
              management and performing design and code review.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have officially ended my service in Ascenda on 20 March 2023.

              During my service in Teckwah, I was responsible for new enhancements and bug fixing for the company's
              warehouse management systems. Specifically, I have helped implement a new shopping cart module for the
              system, and developed a framework for an administration module for the company's vLocate web application.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the side, I have also helped implement a workflow system that allows the various departments in the
              company to create requests that flow through the departments, replacing their existing paper-based
              workflow. As part of this project, I have created custom plugins for the base workflow system, Joget
              Workflow.

              I have officially ended my service in Teckwah on 4th August 2016.

              During the 2 years and 10 months with Ecquaria, I've been working on the State Court's Integrated
              Criminal Case Filing and Management System (ICMS), which transforms the heavily paper-based criminal
              justice system to one that is automated and streamlined.

              My job scope involved both managerial and technical roles. As the project lead, I was responsible for
              overseeing the system development, testing and production support. On the technical side, I played the
              business analyst role, gathered requirements, wrote specification documentations and created prototypes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from working on the project, I was also mentor to five interns, providing guidance to them as they
              performed various tasks assigned to them.

              I have officially ended my service in Ecquaria Technologies on 2nd April 2015.
