I tend to forget things I've done or learnt. I figured that the main reason is probably because I don't document things I've done. So from now on, I will try to document all that I've learnt, so that my future self can refer back to these documentations whenever necessary. I hope that at the same time it will also benefit those who are trying to learn the same thing I have learnt.
