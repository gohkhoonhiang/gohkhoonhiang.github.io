I haven't been blogging for the past month, because I have been busy with job hunting. I'm happy to announce that I have landed a job with [Kaligo](https://www.kaligo.com/) as a Software Engineer! The not so good news is that they use Ruby on Rails for the server-side, that means I have to do a lot of homework before I start joining them in August. But, I mentioned in a [previous post]({{site.url}}/2016/05/experience-with-momocentral-part-2/) that I'm going to learn Ruby on Rails for more freelancing opportunities, so this is actually a perfect time for me to stop dreaming and start learning.

# Scratching the Surface
As I was applying to Kaligo, I attempted their technical test. They didn't require me to code in Ruby and Rails, and I could have used Java or Python for the test. But, having a little too much pride (sometimes not a good thing), I decided to prove my "ability to learn fast" by coding in Ruby on Rails.

I took an evening going through the [interactive tutorial](http://tryruby.org/), reading a [quick introductory tutorial](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/), scanning the [String APIs](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html) and studying some parts of the [Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). Then, I spent one weekend coding the [Human Resource Machine Interpreter](https://github.com/gohkhoonhiang/humanresourcemachine/blob/master/interpreter.rb) in Ruby to practice what I have learnt that evening. When I finally received the test, I went through the [Rails quick start guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) *while* attempting the technical test. Fortunately for me, I managed to finish the test and produced some [result](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), sufficient for me to move on to the on-site interview. However, during the on-site code review, I still had problem writing Ruby code without frequent reference to docs or asking my interviewer. Obviously, what I have done that evening and weekend was barely scratching the surface.

# The Six-week Learning Project
When I got accepted for the job, my soon-to-be CTO asked me a very important question: **Do you think you can pick up Ruby by the time you join us?**, or something along that line. My answer has got to be: **I will learn Ruby after work in the two months before joining**. To keep my promise to him, I have planned a six-week learning project for Ruby *and* Rails.

In the next six weeks, I will learn both Ruby and Rails, hopefully completing the learning project by building an app in the final week. Every week, I will blog about what I have learnt. After writing the [Tornado tutorial](https://gohkhoonhiang.github.io/coloredlist), I have come to realize that the best way to learn is to teach. Blogging about what I have learnt is one way to teach and reinforce the knowledge I have gained. Another reason for making this learning project public on the blog is that I have to be accountable for what I say in public, so I cannot abandon the project half-way no matter how hard it will become. :')

So, stay tuned for the six-week tutorial series in the next few weeks! :)

# PS
After learning a little about Ruby and meeting some Rubyist at a meetup, I find that the Ruby community seems to be very "extroverted" and "fun-loving". From funny method names like `String.squeeze`, to funny gem names like `HTTParty`, to a very humourous talk given by a Rubyist at the last meetup, they all show the "light-hearted" side of Ruby. Perhaps that is the reason why the community has been growing so much in the recent years. It makes programming seems less daunting and more interesting. Being an introvert myself, this can be quite overwhelming for me, especially at my first Ruby meetup. But, I have to learn to embrace the "extroversion" of the community when I become a Ruby developer soon. Of course, I only have barely a week or two of encounter with Ruby and its community, my observation may not be representative of the truth. If you are an introverted Ruby developer, please leave me a comment and say Hi, it would be a relief for me knowing that I'm not alone here. :)
