description: This post is about why I have written yet another Tornado tutorial

I have asked myself the same question before: "Why write another Tornado tutorial when there are already so many out there, and many of them have followed the best practices?"

No doubt these tutorials or sample codes have been great or are even the best you can find in the Tornado space, for example [this](https://github.com/st4lk/acl_webapp). However, my personal experience is that often I don't understand what these codes are doing. Their code structure is so good that I have no idea how it comes about, basically I have used their code base without understanding how things work. This is bad news. It means I haven't learnt anything about the framework, and I will never be able to write a new project from scratch without relying on all these sample codes out there.

I wonder if anyone else has faced the same problem as I did. That question aside, I thought I should take up the responsibility to teach myself how to write a Tornado app from scratch. This means my initial code will be very messy, not following the best practices, and will be one gigantic monolithic file where everything is dumped inside. From there, I will look at other sample codes, then try to figure out how to transform my single-file app into a properly-structured app.

After failing to learn a few things in the past by following other people's tutorials, I finally realized that the best way to learn is to write the tutorial myself. This is how [Coloredlist Tornado Tutorial](http://gohkhoonhiang.github.io/coloredlist) has been born. It is basically a documentation of the transformation of my simplistic code base into a more structured project that tries to follow best practices. You will notice that I actually write down the process of restructuring my project, instead of just presenting the final outcome which is a properly-structured app. If I had done that, this tutorial will be no different from others out there, worse is that mine is not even a *best practice* tutorial.

This is definitely not the best tutorial, it is definitely not a *best practice* tutorial, but more of a tutorial about how a Tornado project transforms from nothing to something.

I hope it can be as useful to you as it has been useful to me, not so much due to the content, but the process I have used to learn a new framework.
